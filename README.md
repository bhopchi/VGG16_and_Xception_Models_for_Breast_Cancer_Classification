# Breast Cancer Classification using VGG16 and Xception Models

This repository provides an in-depth implementation of **VGG16** and **Xception** models for breast cancer classification using deep learning. It leverages transfer learning and state-of-the-art neural networks to analyze histopathological images, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-scores. The repository also includes a hybrid model combining VGG16 and ResNet50 to optimize classification performance further.

## Features
- **VGG16 Model**: A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) fine-tuned for breast cancer classification.
- **Xception Model**: A depthwise separable CNN with improved performance over traditional architectures.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines VGG16 and ResNet50 to utilize strengths of both architectures for better accuracy and generalization.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score comparisons for all models.
- **Transfer Learning**: Use of pre-trained weights on ImageNet to improve feature extraction and reduce training time.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises histopathological images of breast cancer. Images are categorized into multiple classes (e.g., benign and malignant). The directory structure adheres to TensorFlow's `image_dataset_from_directory` format.

**Directory Structure Example**:
```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── class_2/
│       ├── image1.jpg
│       └── ...
├── val/
│   ├── class_1/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── class_2/
│       ├── image1.jpg
│       └── ...
```

## Models and Architectures
1. **VGG16**:
   - Pre-trained on ImageNet.
   - Fine-tuned on breast cancer images with a custom fully connected layer for classification.
   
2. **Xception**:
   - A modern CNN with depthwise separable convolutions.
   - Incorporates attention mechanisms and Gaussian noise layers to enhance robustness.

3. **Hybrid (VGG16 + ResNet50)**:
   - Concatenates features extracted from VGG16 and ResNet50.
   - Utilizes dense layers for final classification, ensuring an optimized feature representation.
